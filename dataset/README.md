## what's this
this folder is the source code of how I gain the train dataset.

show the dataset in release(include main.py and rely).

## step
1.  unpack th-dataset release
2.  use project like thtool (include thtool), or play TouHou game by yourself, and run main.py. it will generate the dataset automatically.

> there is no need to say that collecting a dataset is a hard work. but, I can gain the label data by reading memory, play th-game by other project like this project, then, I can gain the dataset automatically.
